# text-analysis-project
The focus of this project is my research question: ‘Can sentiment analysis be used to map the love triangle in Catherine Doyle’s series of novels?’.
To answer this question I sourced and compiled a dataset of the novels. I analysed the data using seminent analysis and stylometry. Sentiment analysis was chosen to map out this research question because the dataset focuses on a love triangle. Love triangles rely on emotion and will use sentimental words. 
I built two programs - the first a name count that can count the frequency of each love interests name. The second - calculates how many positive, negative or neutral associations the name has using a wordlist.
The results were visualised in Python using Pandas and Matplolib in Jupyter Notebook. The results were also visualised in Tableau.
